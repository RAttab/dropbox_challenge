This project all three solutions to the dropbox challenges. The questions can be found at
this URL: 

     http://www.dropbox.com/jobs/challenges

Note that these are all homebrewed solutions so I'm pretty sure that there exists some 
better solutions for these problems (especially for the rectangle packing problem).
On the other hand, looking up solutions wouldn't be very fun or challenging :)

The project is built using a barebone CMake configuration so the following lines will
build everything for you:
    
    cmake CMakeLists.txt
    make

This will generate all the three solutions to the challenges :
     
    boxpack -> First challenge
    filevents -> Second challenge
    diet -> Third challenge

To run the solutions using command line inputs, just run them as is. The executables 
also contains some tests that can be run by appending any arguments:

    ./boxpack 1
    ./filevents 1
    ./diet 1

Note that both the boxpack and the diet solutions have extra debugging information that
are dumped into the std err stream. These can be filtered out like so (in linux):

    ./boxpack 1 2> /dev/null
    ./diet 1 2> /dev/null
