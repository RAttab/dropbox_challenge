This project all three solutions to the dropbox challenges. The questions can be found at
this URL: http://www.dropbox.com/jobs/challenges

The project is built using a barebone CMake configuration so the following lines will
build everything for you:
    
    cmake CMakeLists.txt
    make

This will generate the three executable for each challenge :
     
    boxpack -> First challenge
    filevents -> Second challenge
    diet -> Third challenge

Just execute them with input from the command line, just execute them as is. The
executables also contains some tests that can be run by adding any arguments.

    ./boxpack 1
    ./filevents 1
    ./diet 1
